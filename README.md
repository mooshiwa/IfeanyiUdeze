**`Business Analyst (Modelling/Visualization/Storytelling)`**

I'm a Senior Data and Business Analyst with 4 years of experience in a Big 4 (Management Consulting). My favourite tools are MS Excel, Big Query for SQL, Power BI and Tableau for visualizations, and R for scripting. All projects on my portfolio are topics I find interesting as I look to solve real world problems.

    <summary><h3>ðŸ§³ Ifeanyi's Career Journey</h3></summary> 
        My analyst journey started as 12 year old exploring a new computer which my father bought. Since there were no games, I played with MS Excel by plotting useless charts and making random mathematical calculations. I went on to study Mechanical Engineering in the university where I understood the concept of data science and statistics. I had a desire to get into management consulting early on in my career as, to me, that meant exposure to as many industries as possible while getting a platform to grow and learn from experts. At PwC, I worked on various data analysis and financial analysis projects using any tool I could lay my hands on. Eventually, I focused on delivering sustainable analysis to businesses and have now started to post all projects I work on outside of work here.
